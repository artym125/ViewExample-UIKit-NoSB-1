# View Example (UIKit) â„–1

This is a view written in the **Swift** programming language. In this example, I only used **UIKit** without using a Storyboard. Storyboard.main is removed from the project. All code is written in file **ViewController**. I think that there is no point in dividing it, because this is only an example how to written such view.
